Create a new folder `flowplayer-commercial` in `wp-content`. Place the files in this new folder. The option in the settings to use Floplayer CDN should be disabled.

Nothing, other then it being disabled.

= What happens when I uninstall the plugin? =

Why would you want to do that? :-) If you do need to uninstall the plugin all of the data (Flowplayer videos and settings) will be deleted so that you do not have unnecessary data left on your database. Your media files will not be deleted. If you want to backup the Flowplayer videos that you have created you can easily export them under Tools -> Export -> Videos.
