== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the "Send to Editor" button inactive? =

The button becomes active once the video preview is shown. For the preview to work you need to provide a video file that
is supported by your web browser. See here for some info on video formats on different browsers: http://flowplayer.org/docs/#video-formats
